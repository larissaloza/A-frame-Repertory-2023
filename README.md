This is the "A-frame Repository", an exercise created with HTML and the A-frame framework, with the aim of creating a document containing all the entities, interactions and effects investigated through learning.

The objective was to have a repository that would be useful when starting a totally new project, already having the code for everything, or almost everything, that A-frame offers.

This exercise was created in 2023 for the course called "Create your 3D space on the web with A-frame" that I taught to the students of the School of Design of the National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature, in Mexico.
